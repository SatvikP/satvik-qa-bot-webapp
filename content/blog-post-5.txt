I was not good at sports growing up. I was always picked last in the neighbourhood games. Academic excellence was always the priority in my family. 

In 2021, I felt stuck in a job I hated and it had a toll on my well-being. I weighed around 90kgs. 

I started working out to lose weight and flaunt my 6-pack abs. 
I lost more than 20kgs. But, I need more reasons to keep going. 
I learnt some cool calisthenics movements and took up long distance running. 

I hated running all my life. But, my first 10K with a friend changed that forever. I ran it under 60 minutes. I realised I could do anything I wanted and the only limit is the one I tell myself. I have logged more than 1000 KM on my Strava. 

My current 10K PR - 48:59
My current Half Marathon PR - 1:55:00
My first HYROX - Men's Singles - 1:59:00

My next big race is the Ladakh Half Marathon in September 2025.
